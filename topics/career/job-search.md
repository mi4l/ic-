# Job Searching as a Software Engineer
I'm hoping this document can provide some insight into what bootcamp grads should focus on as well others who may be looking for a job in software engineering who already have a little experience.  In my opinion, it comes in 3 parts: 1) self-branding, 2) proof of skill, and 3) interview prep. 

These aspects are all presentational and are meant to prove to an employer that speaking with you is worth their time and that you can do the job they want you to do.

## Branding
Branding offers employers some insight into your habits as a software engineer.  This is primarily done through a personal website, LinkedIn profile, and a GitHub profile.  You may want other profiles (Indeed, Hired, Angel.co, Dev.to, Medium) as well to make yourself more available to work as well as expose yourself to ideas/articles.

Every profile you create should be created and maintained well.  You need to put in a lot of effort to fill everything out, and not make yourself seem unprofessional/you don't care.  That doesn't mean your profiles shouldn't have personality, it just means they shouldn't be blank or look sloppy.

### LinkedIn
Your LinkedIn profile is like a long-form résumé. For each employer you have, you should describe the company in 3-4 sentences.  For each title you have, you should describe your responsibilities in 3-4, and then create a bulleted list of specific accomplishments.  If you have experience as a developer, it's helpful to also list the technologies you've used.

The bulleted list of accomplishments will vary quite a bit depending on your experience.  At first, as an entry-level or junior developer, you will not have solved many large-scale problems.  You'll probably benefit from listing out bits and pieces of the work that you've done.

Here's an example from my LinkedIn profile when I was an entry-level developer:

```
LearnBIG was a provider of enterprise video training curricula for corporate clients. I worked on a small, Agile team developing and testing a web-based eLearning platform using JavaScript and Node.js.

⬩ Utilized a multitude of browser APIs to create robust interactive eLearning video courses on a Node.js platform
⬩ Collaborated closely with product and creative teams to create training interactions that have reached tens of thousands of users
⬩ Assisted DevOps in creating internal tools to help increase the productivity of our engineering, content creation, and video production teams using React
⬩ Focused heavily on legacy browser performance and compatibility using automated tests, linting, and code review

Tech:
⬩ JavaScript(ES5, jQuery, React, Handlebars)
⬩ HTML
⬩ CSS
⬩ Gulp, Webpack
```

I described what I did and gave some insight into the scale.  I mention the tech stack.  That's really it.  A junior developer will _not_ have made a lot of bottom-line influencing implementations or decisions, but their experience should show that they can get their hands dirty and build stuff.  **The same goes for projects.**  If you've never had a tech job, use project experience as experience.

If you do have a bit more experience, maybe you've TA'd or you've actually had a tech job, you should try to talk a little about how your work impacted the company as a whole.

Here's an example from a position where I had a lot more experience and responsibility.  I also mentioned an award:

```
Fullstack software engineer on Hearsay's platform team, which oversees business-critical services and infrastructure. My team primarily focuses on our contact management service, but also handles public APIs, integrations, and other wide-reaching applications.

**Awarded the GSRD Focus award for owning and leading cross-functional large team efforts, mentoring peers, addressing deep-rooted tech debt, and leading by example

⬩ Established cross-framework interoperability patterns allowing for a pragmatic transition between languages or frameworks in-place
⬩ De-coupled UI applications from a monolithic frontend UI into standalone, shareable micro UIs
⬩ Led grassroots cross-functional initiatives to overcome massive strategic and technical challenges, resulting in workflows that delight users and applications that are easy for developers to maintain
⬩ Established processes and code standards for applications across Hearsay to promote better maintainability

Tech:
⬩ JavaScript/TypeScript
⬩ Python
⬩ React
⬩ Redux
⬩ Django
⬩ AWS (DynamoDB, S3, EC2, ElasticSearch, SQS, EventBridge)
```
The descriptor of impact is very important here.  It allows employers to know how you can scale an organization and how your impact can be felt.

Make sure you fill out that LinkedIn profile and make yourself sound great.  It might take awhile, but it'll offer solid returns.

### GitHub
GitHub's a place where you should experiment and show off **all** of your code -- the good ideas, the bad ideas, the stupid stuff, and the terrible stuff.  Quantity and green squares (GitHub's measurement of activity) are important because they show that you're active, flexing your skills, and keeping your skills fresh.  Like LinkedIn, make sure your profile is filled out and you have a profile image.

GitHub also has a feature called a README, which is basically a way for you to create a markdown-based landing page for yourself, similar to a project README.  You can see an example of this [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/github-profile-readme/#:~:text=A%20GitHub%20profile%20README%20is%20a%20feature%20of%20GitHub%20that,page%2C%20above%20the%20pinned%20repositories.).

Keep your GitHub looking fresh.  As you gain a better understanding of the world of software development, you should start to follow projects you enjoy and dig into source.  Use [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com) to jot down ideas and create little shareable snippets.  I use gists to either communicate things to people quickly or to save small ideas or patterns I think are worthwhile.

As an example, here's a [REST client factory](https://gist.github.com/mskalandunas/f7eeb931c259728dcb25a8951f7966cf) I created to demonstrate a composable, functional, factory pattern.

Don't be afraid to have stupid code pushed up to GitHub.  Experiment and have fun.

### Personal Site
If you're entry level or junior, you'll want your personal site to act like a portfolio.  The more senior you get, the less your site matters and the more it can be anything you want, from a business card to a personal statement to whatever.  I'm going to focus on having a portfolio site in this section.

Your portfolio site should be well organized, stand out, and show off your projects.  It shouldn't have too much content, and I also think you should keep it simple on an infrastructural level -- don't worry about serving your own site, have it handled via a service like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or something similarly simple.

#### Content
In terms of site content, your name, role, skills, and contact information should be easy to find.  Display your projects in an interesting way using images, gifs, and videos.

Honestly, it's okay (and probably for the best) to borrow from a better designed site to start, since realistically you won't have the design chops to come up with something dope.  I do this, lots of people do this.  Sometimes I'll borrow from print I find, sometimes from designs, either way it's best to recognize your weaknesses up front and try to fill any gaps as best you can.

That said, you shouldn't straight up copy anything.  Borrow ideas but not literal HTML/CSS/JS.

#### Examples
Here're some examples of portfolio sites I like:

- https://www.richardekwonye.com/ - Modern, typography-first
- https://wodniack.dev/ - A little wild, some performance issues, decent ideas
- https://henriheymans.com/ - Side scrolling, kind of interesting
- https://shapefarm.net/ - Good layout, modern touches
- https://eumray.com/ - Portfolio is straightforward and fun

These are complex and most likely far outside of your comfort zone, but it's good to look at these and get an idea for what's out there.  Write out your content sections and high-level content, ideate on the structure, and start digging around for ideas that fit your style.  

Here're some other websites you can look at for design/site ideas:

## Proof of Skill
Employers shouldn't have to work too hard to figure out if you have chops.  More senior developers can get an interview quickly with just résumé or a LinkedIn profile, but when starting out a GitHub profile will do that work.  

Your GitHub profile should contain 3-4 projects that show off core skills.  You need to show people that you can do the job.  If you manage to pass an interview and can not actually perform any of the duties of your role, it'll be extremely awkward and probably won't last long.

### Projects
I'm going to focus on web-specific projects here since I originally created this document for web development bootcamp grads.  

The breadth of your projects should demonstrate an understanding of basic fullstack skills, which are essentially the user experience, lifecycle of an HTTP request, and data persistence.  Each project does not need to demonstrate all of these, but having at least one project demonstrate a fullstack application is good.

Here's an example group of projects:
- **A fullstack application** -- This should be more complex than something like a todo list, and should show skills in a major frontend library/framework (React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc), a server library (Express, FastAPI, Echo), and a database.  It should have a clean UI with a sensible user experience (feedback as things load, no jank, etc).  TypeScript in the UI is a bonus.
- **A fun, presentational project** -- This should be something very frontend focused with a sleek UI that's fun to interact with.  Ideally this would be done in vanilla JavaScript or a popular library/framework.  It'd be great if this also used a 3rd party API.
- **Something Experimental** -- Think outside of the box a little bit and explore.  This could be a game, something using WebGL, use experimental browser audio APIs, etc.  It should show a little creativity.
- **OS/Script/Backend** -- I'd recommend diving deeper into the backend and maybe in an unfamiliar language to broaden your skills and show off a little bit.  A sample service, a selenium script to automate some browser activity, an electron app, just try something uncomfortable.

These don't need to be super deep, but they should be pretty buttoned up and simple to run.  Tests are important for the fullstack application and the "OS/Script/Backend" project.  If I saw an entry level engineer with these projects on their GitHub profile, I may just ask for a walkthrough of each one and that'd be the extent of the technical interview.  It'd be solid.

### Experience
When you're starting out there may be nothing to put here, but I'd recommend listing any collaborative experience with other people, especially if some project management was involved.  It's important to see how someone works with a team and if they're coachable.  Being able to work through "lone wolf" development phases into something scalable that works in an actual company is important to show off.

## Interviews
Interviewing requires understanding and skill in several areas:

- Proficiency with a programming language
- Experience in a technological domain (Frontend, backend, reliability, etc)
- Code challenges (algorithms and data structures)
- Project management and organiational skills

As an example, a frontend engineer interviewee could meet these requirements by understanding:

- JavaScript
- Browser-native frontend technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML; React, Redux, SCSS; common strategies for UI problems (collection loading, image loading, feedback, HTTP)
- Array methods, Object methods, String methods, arrays, sets, objects, loops, and recursion
- Breaking down projects into smaller, more digestible fragments; working with teams; code reviewing

### Proficiency with a Programming Language
Using JavaScript as an example (since most people reading this will be frontend peeps), one should be comfortable with the following:

- Control flow
  - if/else
  - switch
- Loops
  - for
    - in/of
    - labeled/break/continue
  - while
    - do
- Data structures
  - Objects
  - Arrays
  - Sets/Maps
- Functions/fat arrow functions
- Classes
- Hoisting
- Execution Context
- Async
  - Callbacks
  - Async/Await
  - Promises

Note that these lists are not exhaustive.
